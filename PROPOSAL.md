# Audiate

Author: Beth Fineberg

#### What kind of project you want to do? 
I would like to create a tool that allows you to play around with audio. My project would allow an input
audio file or choose a type of wave, then filter them and perform different wave math operations with them. 
My project will have a GUI that allows a user to decide which effects to apply and how they will be applied.
I would also like to illustrate what the resulting sounds look like using Cinder.

#### What background knowledge do you have on this kind of project, and why do you want to do this project?
I am majoring in Computer Science and Music, so I already have a lot of background knowledge about
music/audio related concepts. I would like to dive more into DSP concepts, because it will be 
relevant for me in later coursework. This project would give me the opportunity to play around
with these concepts and learn along the way.

#### What specific external libraries will you need?
I plan to use the Cinder audio library for the audio component of my project. This will allow me to
load audio files and manipulate them. Cinder audio will also allow me to generate different types
of sound waves and control using wave math with these generated sounds.


For the GUI component of my project, I would like to use a Cinder Block library. I decided to go with
Cinder-ImGui (https://github.com/simongeilfus/Cinder-ImGui). This will allow me to have simple and
clean looking controls for audio manipulation.


If I find that I am in need of another library for any kind of functionality or I don't like a specific
library I chose out there, there are so many possible resources out there that I can play it by ear.

#### A rough timeline of what will get accomplished and when:
Week 1: 
    
    * Figure out how to play songs and apply effects to audio files
    * Make a wireframe for what my GUI will look life
    * Make a simple demo showing ImGui is a good option for my GUI
    
Week 2:

    * Code the GUI itself
    * Make it so the GUI can play a sound with an effect
    * Implement functionality for some of the effects to be controled by the GUI
    * Add wave illustration at the bottom of the Cinder window
    
Week 3: 

    * Finish any previous goals that I was not able to achieve
    * Finish linking effects with GUI so that all effects are working
    * Add testing for my functions and make sure object decomposition is good
    * Write necessary documentation
    * Implement any stretch goals

#### If you were to finish the project early, what extra "stretch goals" could you implement?
I am not sure if this will be easy or difficult, so I will play it by ear, but I think it would be 
cool to figure out how to apply multiple effects to an audio file simultaneously. Once I get more
acquainted with how the library works, I will think more about this and how difficult it would be
to implement. If it's impossibly difficult, I don't think its completely necessary.

I am not sure if this is even possible with the project structure, but it could be cool to figure
out how to apply audio effects using libraries other than Cinder.

Overall, I'm going to probably come up with more stretch ideas as I work on the project and get an
idea of what's possible.
